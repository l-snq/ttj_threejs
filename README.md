# This is my portfolio project. 

It's written in React, Next.js, and threejs, as a simple but fun project to demonstrate my skills as a programmer!

## TODO!
1. I want to be able to render a model (either a gltf or an obj model)


Another thought I have is that i should completely convert this project to using javascript instead of typescript as it doesn't have full typescript support. (Like with GLTF)
